Why Vigenère? This method can be done easily in your head
or with pen and paper.

How to encrypt and decrypt

Plaintext (P)
Key (K)
Ciphertext (C)

The formula for individual characters is:

Encrypt: P + K = C
Decrypt: C - K = P

First, assign a number to each of the 26 letters of the alphabet.
Typically, we see A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, and all the way to Z = 26.


What is "A1"?

"A1" means A = 1. The encoding table used in this page differs
from the traditional Vigenère table by an offset of one space.

Looking at the top-left corner of the table, ...

It is much more common to see the alphabet start with A = 1 and end
at Z = 26. 

So, when adding A + A, it means 1 + 1 = 2 (B). With the traditional
table, the calculation result, 1 + 1 = 2, would have to be subtracted
by 1 to give the expected result of A (1).

Subtract/add 26 so that the result falls in the range of 1-26.
The encrypted alphabet wraps around both ways.

Spaces from the plaintext are removed to make cracking even more
difficult (by eliminating guesses of short words like THE, I, and OF).

However, the ciphertext is grouped into chunks of four characters, to
reduce the possibility of errors when copying by hand.

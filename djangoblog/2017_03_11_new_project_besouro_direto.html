        <h1>Besouro Direto, a New Django Project</h1>
        <h3>11 March, 2017</h3>
        
        <p>
            After starting and stopping multiple Django projects, I finally decided to take some notes. What I usually do is keep two windows in Emacs: one with an older project and the other with the new one, then copy and paste code.
        </p>

        <p>
            Here, I hope to create a more organized, step-by-step guide from the beginning.
        </p>

        <p>
            The current Django project I am developing is called Besouro Direto, a calculator and record-keeping app for investments in Brazil's government bond program called <a href="http://www.tesouro.fazenda.gov.br/tesouro-direto" target="_blank">Tesouro Direto</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            A "<a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Besouro" target="_blank">besouro</a>" is a beetle and is somewhat related to growing investments. Some species roll a ball of dung around, gradually making it bigger. As I feel Tesouro Direto won't make you rich overnight, it is a fitting analogy.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now, let's proceed to the setup and the coding
        </p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    First, I want Python 3 and Django. (You may prefer Python 2.7 and that's OK. But I want the future of the language). I am developing in Ubuntu and Python 2 seems to be the default, so I set up a <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv" target="_blank">virtualenv</a>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There are many ways to install virtualenv; the easiest is probably with your system's package manager. You may also want virtualenvwrapper to make managing multiple virtualenvs easier. Here, I show the bare minimum.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In your home directory, or a base directory for your projects, run:
                </p>
                
                <pre>
heitor:~$ virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 venv
                </pre>

                <p>
                    Now activate the virtualenv.
                </p>

                <pre>
heitor:~$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) heitor:~$ pip install Django
                </pre>

                <p>
                    After all this setup, start a new Django project. (dashes are not OK in project names, so I use an underscore).
                </p>

                <pre>
(venv) heitor:~$ django-admin startproject besouro_direto
                </pre>
            </li>

            <li>
                I want a few "default" Django apps available: sitewide and experimental. Sitewide templates such as the root index.html, navigation code, and stylesheets will be placed there. The experimental folder will store views, calculations, and JavaScript that I first want to try out without polluting the main apps' files and folders.

                <pre>
(venv) heitor:~$ cd besouro_direto
(venv) heitor:~/besouro_direto$ python manage.py startapp sitewide
(venv) heitor:~/besouro_direto$ python manage.py startapp experimental
                </pre>
            </li>

            <li>
                I'm impatient, so I frequently check whether things are working as expected. Right now, I can check that the built-in Admin site works. I set up the default database tables with <code>migrate</code> and then create a superuser. Fill in the prompts.
                
                <pre>
(venv) heitor:~/besouro_direto$ python manage.py migrate
(venv) heitor:~/besouro_direto$ python manage.py createsuperuser
                </pre>
            </li>

            <li>
                Start the development server (by default, it listens on port 8000)

                <pre>
(venv) heitor:~/besouro_direto$ python manage.py runserver
                </pre>

                The only meaningful thing available is the Admin site, reachable at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/</a> Use the superuser account created above. The only thing we can do is manage the site's users and groups.
            </li>

            <li>
                Now that we checked that the basic setup works, we should start planning our project. I usually create
                <ul type="disc">
                    <li>README.txt (describes what the project is about)</li>
                    <li>TODO.txt (a list of tasks and ideas to be tested and implemented)</li>
                    <li>LICENSE.txt (says how your code can be used by others)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                Create a <code>.gitignore</code> file in the base directory to avoid saving bytecode and the local database.
                <pre class="py">
# .gitignore

__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class

# Django stuff:
*.log
db.sqlite3
                </pre>
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Once we have the description of our project done, we should set up a repo on <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a> (or another online version control system) to save our work.
            </li>

        </ol>
        
        <p>
            The <code>besouro_direto</code> base directory looks like this, excluding all <code>__init__.py</code> and <code>__pycache__</code>:
            <pre>
besouro_direto (the Django project's base directory)
|
+- besouro_direto
|  |   (yes, it is a subdirectory with the same name as the 
|  |    base directory and I find it confusing)
|  +- settings.py (project-wide settings that must be updated
|  |               every time a new app is created)
|  +- urls.py (routes URLs to views)
|  +- wsgi.py (default settings for deployment)
|
+- experimental (we created this app with python manage.py startapp)
|  +- migrations (currently empty)
|  +- admin.py   (models registered here appear in the Admin site)
|  +- apps.py    (define app metadata here)
|  +- models.py  (define data models here)
|  +- tests.py   (test your app's logic)
|  +- views.py   (decide what to present to the end user)
|
+- sitewide
|  +- migrations (same file structure as 'experimental')
|  +- admin.py
|  +- apps.py
|  +- models.py
|  +- tests.py
|  +- views.py
|
+- LICENSE.txt
+- README.txt 
+- TODO.txt
+- db.sqlite3 (the development database)
+- manage.py (executes administration commands like starting the
              development server, creating apps, and applying
              migrations)
            </pre>
        </p>

        <p>
            As a superuser, we can manage our site's users, but there is not yet any content to manage!
        </p>

        <p>
            Next, we will <a href="2017_03_12_bond_models.html">create models for Tesouro Direto bonds</a>, whose data is meant to be seen by everyone.

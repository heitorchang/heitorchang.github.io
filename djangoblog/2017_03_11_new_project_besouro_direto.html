        <h1>Besouro Direto, a New Django Project</h1>
        <h3>11 March, 2017</h3>
        
        <p>
            After starting and stopping multiple Django projects, I finally decided to take some notes. What I usually do is keep two windows in Emacs: one with an older project and the other with the new one, then copy and paste code.
        </p>

        <p>
            Here, I hope to create a more organized, step-by-step guide from the beginning.
        </p>

        <p>
            The current Django project I am developing is called Besouro Direto, a calculator and record-keeping app for investments in Brazil's government bond program called <a href="http://www.tesouro.fazenda.gov.br/tesouro-direto" target="_blank">Tesouro Direto</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            A "<a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Besouro" target="_blank">besouro</a>" is a beetle and is somewhat related to growing investments. Some species roll a ball of dung around, gradually making it bigger. As I feel Tesouro Direto won't make you rich overnight, it is a fitting analogy.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now, let's proceed to the setup and the coding
        </p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    First, I want Python 3 and Django. (You may prefer Python 2.7 and that's OK. But I want the future of the language). I am developing in Ubuntu and Python 2 seems to be the default, so I set up a <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv" target="_blank">virtualenv</a>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There are many ways to install virtualenv; the easiest is probably with your system's package manager. You may also want virtualenvwrapper to make managing multiple virtualenvs easier. Here, I show the bare minimum.
                </p>

                <pre>
heitor:~$ virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 venv
                </pre>

                <p>
                    Now activate the virtualenv.
                </p>

                <pre>
heitor:~$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) heitor:~$ pip install Django
                </pre>

                <p>
                    After all this setup, start a new Django project. (dashes are not OK in project names, so I use an underscore).
                </p>

                <pre>
(venv) heitor:~$ django-admin startproject besouro_direto
                </pre>
            </li>

            <li>
                I want a few "default" Django apps available: sitewide and experimental. Sitewide templates such as the root index.html and navigation code can be placed there. The experimental folder will store views, computations, and JavaScript that I want to try out without polluting the main apps.

                <pre>
(venv) heitor:~$ cd besouro_direto
(venv) heitor:~/besouro_direto$ python manage.py startapp sitewide
(venv) heitor:~/besouro_direto$ python manage.py startapp experimental
                </pre>
            </li>

            <li>
                I'm impatient, so I frequently check that things are working as expected. Right now, I can check that the built-in Admin app works. I set up the default database tables with <code>migrate</code> and then create a superuser. Fill in the prompts.
                
                <pre>
(venv) heitor:~/besouro_direto$ python manage.py migrate
(venv) heitor:~/besouro_direto$ python manage.py createsuperuser
                </pre>
            </li>

            <li>
                Test the development server (by default, it listens on port 8000)

                <pre>
(venv) heitor:~/besouro_direto$ python manage.py runserver
                </pre>

                The only meaningful thing that is available is the Admin interface, reachable at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/</a> Use the superuser account created above. The only thing we can do is manage the site's users and groups.
            </li>

            <li>
                Now that we checked that the basic setup works, we should start planning our project. I usually create README.txt, TODO.txt, and LICENSE.txt.
            </li>

            <li>
                Create a .gitignore file to avoid saving bytecode and the local database.
                <pre class="py">
# .gitignore

__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class

# Django stuff:
*.log
db.sqlite3
                </pre>
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Once we have the description of our project done, we should set up a repo on <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a> (or another online version control system) to save our work.
            </li>

        </ol>

        <p>
            As a superuser, we can manage our site's users, but there is not yet any content to manage! Next time, we will create models for Tesouro Direto bonds. Once they are in place, anyone should be able to browse their basic characteristics.
        </p>

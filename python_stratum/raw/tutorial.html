$h1 Tutorial

There are three main parts to this website:

!html
<ul>
  <li>On the left, in green, is the <strong>Code editor</strong>. You will spend most of the time writing code there.</li>
  <li>On the right, in light yellow, is the <strong>Book content</strong>. It contains the main text of this book.</li>
  <li>On the bottom, in dark blue, is the <strong>Interpreter</strong>. It contains the heart of the embedded Python system.</li>
</ul>

$h3 Code editor

The <em>Code editor</em> is a temporary location where blocks (or just a single line) of code can be written. This website stores the last 50 code blocks that were evaluated in your browser's <em>localStorage</em>.

To reliably save your original work, you will have to copy and paste your code to a more permanent location.

$h3 Book Content

The <em>Book content</em> includes several <em>code blocks</em>, which appear in a box with a slightly darker background.

Clicking in these code blocks replaces the content of the Code editor (be careful if you have unfinished work!) and also <em>evaluates</em> (processes) the code.

$h3 Python Interpreter

The interpreter runs components developed by the <a href="https://pyodide.org/en/stable/" target="_blank">Pyodide</a> project.

It is possible to type code directly in the interpreter. However, it behaves just like a standard operating system terminal, and the keyboard actions are different from the Code editor's.

$h3 Greetings

Maintaining a long-standing tradition, we will see how to display a greeting in a few different ways.

The <em>function</em> (roughly, a piece of code that performs an action) called `print` will display its <em>argument</em> (a value given, or passed, to the function) in the Python interpreter or terminal where the code is run.

<strong>Exercise:</strong> Click on the left panel and type:

`print("Hello, World!")`

Then, type the combination <strong>Ctrl + Enter</strong> (press and hold Ctrl, then press Enter). This will send the current code to the interpreter. Observe that the words `Hello, World!` appear in the interpreter below.

You may type <strong>Ctrl + Enter</strong> again and again to repeat the code evaluation.

Now, try typing <strong>Alt + Enter</strong>. The interpreter will receive the code, and the editor will become empty. This keyboard shortcut is convenient when you know you don't have to keep the current code.

In order to retrieve older code, type <strong>Ctrl + Up</strong> once or more times. Then, <strong>Ctrl + Down</strong> will scroll backwards in this history.

Typing <strong>Esc</strong> will clear the current contents of the Code editor.

$h3 Interpreter keyboard shortcuts

Working in the interpreter is also possible, though much less convenient if you are writing multiline code. Typing <strong>Enter</strong> will make the interpreter evaluate a single line of code.

To process multiple lines, you have to type <strong>Shift + Enter</strong> to go to the next line.

If you get stuck and wish to start over, type <strong>Ctrl + C</strong>.

I recommend editing code only in the Code editor. However, it's handy to know how a terminal behaves.

$h3 Code blocks in the book's text

Throughout the chapters, there will be blocks of text that explain concepts or defines values. They look like this:

@py
our_planet = "Earth"
our_satellite = "Moon"

print("Hello", our_satellite, "from", our_planet)
@end

Clicking inside this block will replace whatever is in the Code editor with its contents and evaluate it. Be careful if you have unevaluated code in the Code editor!

When you're satisfied trying out the parts of this website, continue on to the next chapter.

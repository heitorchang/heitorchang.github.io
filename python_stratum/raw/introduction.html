$h1 Introduction

`Hello Reader!` This book will show you the basics of <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a>.

This book is named <em>Python Stratum</em> because it covers only the <em>surface layer</em> of programming concepts, open to experimentation directly in the browser, with the least amount of friction.

The topics I will cover include:

!html
<ul>
  <li>Data types</li>
  <li>Functions</li>
  <li>Control flow</li>
  <lI>Object-oriented programming</lI>
</ul>
!end

I hope you enjoy reading this book and trying out the code!

The next page will explain how to write code in this website.

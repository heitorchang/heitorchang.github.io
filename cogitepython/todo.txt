current workflow:

Use thinkpython2.pdf (2nd ed. version 2.2.15) as the source

find translations from linguee.com, wordreference.com and priberam.pt/dlpo.

Use python_para_desenvolvedores as a second source

Find out glossary terms from the portuguese version of think python (thinkpython_port) and Pense Python 2's consolidated glossary

at the end, re-read the whole book side-by-side with the PDF

Build final version in Ubuntu (omits the unnecessary word Documentacao in index)

Translate code and solutions from http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/code/

Submit cogitepython.github.io URL to Google

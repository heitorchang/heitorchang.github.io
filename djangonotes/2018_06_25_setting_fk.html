        <h1>Setting the ForeignKey programmatically</h1>
        <h3>25th June, 2018</h3>

        <div>
            In my SimCup project for simulating World Cup results, I wanted to dynamically assign a match's team by saying "the 1st place team in group A". However, it seems like I have to define a method to set a ForeignKey.
        </div>

        <div>
            To test this idea, I set up a project representing a classroom and several students. We wish to assign the Classroom's best student to one of the students with the highest grade.
        </div>

        <div>
            <pre>
from django.db import models
from django.db.models import Max

class Student(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=16)
    grade = models.IntegerField()
    
    def __str__(self):
        return "{} {}".format(self.name, self.grade)

class Classroom(models.Model):
    teacher = models.CharField(max_length=16)
    best = models.ForeignKey(Student, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

    def setbest(self):
        bestgrade = Student.objects.all().aggregate(Max('grade'))['grade__max']
        beststudent = Student.objects.get(grade=bestgrade)
        self.best = beststudent
        self.save()
    
    def __str__(self):
        return "{} {}".format(self.teacher, self.best)
            </pre>
        </div>

        <div>
            I tested the code in the Admin and shell. Note that changing a student's grade won't automatically update the Classroom's best student. Either a hook is needed or I have to call setbest() every time.
        </div>

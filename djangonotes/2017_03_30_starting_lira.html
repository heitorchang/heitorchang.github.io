        <h1>Starting a new project, Lira</h1>
        <h3>30th March, 2017</h3>

        <p>
            In this series of posts I would like to outline the creation of a Django 1.10 app with these features:
            <ul>
                <li>User management</li>
                <li>Static JavaScript, CSS, and fonts</li>
                <li>Django templates and inheritance</li>
            </ul>

            Lira is a double-entry personal accounting app named after the Turkish and old Italian currencies.
        </p>

        <p>
            A Lira user should be able to define multiple accounts, such as a <span class="highlight_i">bank checking account</span>, that belongs to an account type, in this case, <span class="highlight_i">Assets</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Other accounts may include expenses, such as groceries, and income. Once several accounts are created, every single, new transaction is posted to two accounts simultaneously. This behavior explains the name <span class="highlight_i">double-entry accounting</span>. Due to the self-balancing nature of double-entry accounting, it is always possible to find the source of entry errors.
        </p>

        <p>
            I work in both Windows and Ubuntu, and a useful tool to have is <a href="https://virtualenv.pypa.io/" target="_blank">virtualenv</a> and the set of extensions <a href="https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank">virtualenvwrapper</a>. They create <span class="highlight_i">isolated Python environments</span>. There are many ways to set it up so I won't go into details here. I am using Python 3.5 in both Windows and Ubuntu.
        </p>

        <p>
            To begin, I will create the <code>lira</code> Django app in my home folder, and display the shell commands in a gray box shown below. Following UNIX convention, <code>~</code> refers to my home directory, and <code>$</code>, the shell prompt. After installing Django (my app is using version 1.10), start the new project:
            
            <pre>
~ $ django-admin startproject lira
            </pre>
        </p>

        <p>
            The new project isn't completely empty&mdash;Django includes an Admin app. But to make it usable, we need to apply the default migrations to update the database. Let's also create a superuser to access the Admin app.
            <pre>
~/lira $ python manage.py migrate
~/lira $ python manage.py createsuperuser
            </pre>

            Let's try logging in to the Admin app. Start the development server:
            <pre>
~/lira $ python manage.py runserver
            </pre>

            By default, the development server is accessible through port 8000. To specify another port number, add it after <code>runserver</code>. Go to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/">http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/</a> and use the superuser account created above.
        </p>

        <p>
            We will use the built-in user management later for logins and associating them to accounts and transactions.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now that we made sure the default setup works well, let's add a <code>.gitignore</code> file for saving our work through Git.
            <pre>
# lira/.gitignore

__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class

# Django stuff:
*.log
db.sqlite3
            </pre>    
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Next, we will <a href="2017_03_30_index_custom_font.html">create a sitewide index with a custom font</a>.

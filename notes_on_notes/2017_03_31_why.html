        <h1>Why take notes?</h1>
        <h3>31st March, 2017</h3>

        <div>
            Given the huge volume of technologies available and their quick pace of development, I frequently jump back-and-forth between them, as one technology seems to be a better fit to my new project, or because of plain boredom. After a few months, I often forget how to do even the most basic tasks in the technologies I left behind.
        </div>

        <div>
            I began writing a series of posts outlining the steps of getting a Django project up and running, and in the process noticed that taking notes itself and putting them online is not a simple and obvious process.
        </div>

        <div>
            Since there are a myriad of options catering to every skill level for publishing content online, I will describe how I have been taking notes for my Django project. 
        </div>

        <div>
            I see the benefits of taking notes as:
            <ol>
                <li>developing a quick reference to recreate, step-by-step, a useful product</li>
                <li>keeping track of a sequential thought process</li>
                <li>highlighting tricky conditions</li>
                <li>practicing and improving writing skills</li>
                <li>potentially helping out other readers</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div>
            So, let's begin <a href="2017_03_31_structure.html">the process of writing notes!</a>

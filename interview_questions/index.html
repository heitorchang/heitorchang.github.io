I worked on the first version of the page alone, and over time the scope and number of forecast models tripled. Loading times grew significantly, to about 20 seconds.<br><br>
                It was time for an overhaul. By the time we saw the need to upgrade the page, the company grew from 6 to 14 people, so we had a dedicated front-end specialist and more meteorologists. I was coordinating with the two teams, and responsible for writing the APIs that connected the data produced by the scientists to the front-end client. I also helped with structuring the database. With our efforts we reduced the loading time from 20 seconds to around 3 seconds. I learned some Vue and Postgres techniques from my teammates.

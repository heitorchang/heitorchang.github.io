FRAME IN TERMS OF TEAM'S SUCCESS. HOW WE BUILT THE PROJECT TOGETHER. Creating the company's public website. It shows our products and their details to clients. After the site, we noticed increased sales and clients by about 30%. Prospective clients found us on Google. It also improved salespeople's productivity because they no longer needed to send emails to their clients individually. <br><br>The site was first developed with Python (my main language). The second version, currently in use, is in PHP (it is efficient and straightforward to write). Now I'm developing a third version in React JS because it will create a faster user experience.

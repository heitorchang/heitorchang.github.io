<h1>Visual Studio Code</h1>

<h3>Interactive Python development</h3>

<p>
  Requires installing ipykernel.
</p>

<p>
In an open Python file, click on a triangular "Play" button to the right of the file's tab (hovering over it says "Run current file in interactive window")
</p>

<p>
  After changing the Python source, clicking on this button again will re-evaluate the code.
</p>

<h3>Keybindings</h3>

<p>
  <a href="vscode-files/keybindings.json.txt">Click here to view the latest keybindings</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The file's location in Windows is <code>c:/Users/USERNAME/AppData/Roaming/Code/User/keybindings.json</code>
</p>

<h3>HTML / JavaScript Live Preview</h3>

<p>
  There are many "Live server" extensions but I prefer the (official) Microsoft's "Live Preview" (it has the Microsoft badge under the extension name) despite it still being Experimental.
</p>

<p>
  In the Extensions sidebar, click on the gear icon to access its Settings. Then, change "Auto Refresh Preview" to "On Changes to Saved Files."
</p>

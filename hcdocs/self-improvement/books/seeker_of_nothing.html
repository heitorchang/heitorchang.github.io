<h1>The Seeker of Nothing</h1>

<h3>The seven secrets</h3>

<pre>
POWER

Life is but a journey upon
  which you embark.
As you descend from your
  eternal home,
you are each given a boon:

Choice.

This promise contains your power.
</pre>

<pre>
FREEDOM

Self-identity determines how
  the gift of choice is used,
thus the question, who are you?

In the answer, you will find
  your freedom.
</pre>

<p>
  Can you transcend outward appearances?
</p>

<p>
  When you become truly aware of who you are, you will be free.
</p>

<pre>
PEACE

The universe is perfect,
  a flawless design.
If all that happens
  does not appear so,
there still remains
  a distance to be covered.

Walk ahead, and you will
  see perfection.

It is unavoidable.

This is the passage to peace.
</pre>

<pre>
REDEMPTION

Pain is an event which
  cannot be avoided.
Suffering is a process
  which can.

The light of awareness
  offers protection against
  the darkness of suffering.

This understanding
  guides you to redemption.
</pre>

<p>
  Suffering, unlike pain, is not an event, but a state of mind.
</p>

<p>
  It can be avoided with perspective. It is the way you perceive things that causes happiness or sadness in one's life.
</p>

<p>
  Use the gift of choice to change your perspective on the situation.
</p>

<pre>
HEALING

Surrender, and you will mend
  that which is broken.
Do not differentiate between
  the beaten heart and
  the shattered bone.

In this remedy,
  will healing be found.
</pre>

<p>
  The first step in the healing process is accepting that you are hurt. Allow the emotions to flow.
</p>

<pre>
DIVINITY

You have only one true enemy
  -- pride
You have only one place to go
  -- within

This realization, is Divinity
</pre>

<p>
  Find the activity that opens your heart and engage in it regularly. For example, preparing food.
</p>

<pre>
MAGIC

Be present in the only place
  of importance: the present.

Here is where your
  magic resides.
</pre>

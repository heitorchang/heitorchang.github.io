<h1>Be Water, My Friend (by Shannon Lee)</h1>

<h2>The teachings of Bruce Lee</h2>

<pre>
Empty your mind.
Be formless, shapeless, like water.
You put water into a cup; it becomes the cup.
You put water into a teapot; it becomes the teapot.
You put it into a bottle; it becomes the bottle.
Now water can flow, or it can crash!
Be water, my friend.
</pre>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
  Bruce Lee doesn't want you to be Bruce Lee. He wants you to be the best version of <em>you</em> that you can be.
</p>

<p>
  Do not be tense, but ready; not thinking, but not dreaming; not being set, but flexible. It is being wholly and quietly alive, aware, and alert; ready for whatever may come.
</p>

<h3>The Water Way</h3>

<p>
  Yip Man: Never assert yourself against nature. Never be in frontal opposition to any problem, but control it by swinging with it.
</p>

<p>
  Bruce Lee's core tenet:
</p>

<blockquote>
  Using no way as way, having no limitation as limitation.
</blockquote>

<p>
  Being present is not enough. You must be aware, paying attention, and actively participating.
</p>

<p>
  Of course, it's not possible to always be "on". Life is not always within our control. We get sick, tired, and tend to tune out. We are not meant to be perfect.
</p>

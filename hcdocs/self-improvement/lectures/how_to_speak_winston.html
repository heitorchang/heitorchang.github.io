<h3>How to start</h3>

<p>
  Do not start with a joke. The audience has to adjust itself to you.
</p>

<p>
  Instead, start with <em>empowerment promise</em>. Tell people what they're going to know at the end of the hour that they didn't know at the beginning of the hour.
</p>

<p>
  This is the <strong>reason for being here</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  Example: you will know new things about speaking.
</p>

<h3>Heuristics</h3>

<p>
  It's a good idea to <strong>cycle on the subject</strong>. To ensure everyone gets what you're trying to say, you're going to have to repeat yourself.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Build a fence</strong> around your idea, so it's not confused with someone else's idea.
</p>

<p>
  <em>Verbal punctuation</em>: provide some landmark places announcing it's a good place to get back on track (if someone in the audience fogged out).
</p>

<p>
  Ask a question. It can't be too obvious, nor too difficult.
</p>

<h3>Time and place</h3>

<p>
  11 AM
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Place</strong>: Must be well lit
</p>

<h3>Slides vs. blackboard</h3>

<p>
  Slides are more effective for exposing ideas, while a blackboard is better for teaching.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do not read directly from your slides</li>
  <li>Be in the image</li>
  <li>Keep images simple</li>
  <li>Eliminate clutter</li>
</ul>

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Humans are storytelling and symbolic animals</li>
</ul>

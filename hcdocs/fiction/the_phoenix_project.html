<h3>For immediate release</h3>

<p>
  Steve Masters steps down from his role of chairman after 8 years.
</p>

<p>
  Bob Strauss assumes the role of chairman.
</p>

<p>
  The "Phoenix" program is a plan to tightly integrate its retailing and e-commerce channels.
</p>

<h3>Management movements that benefited the manufacturing plant (Ch. 7)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Theory of Constraints (improvements must be done in the bottleneck)</li>
  <li>Lean production (Toyota Production System)</li>
  <li>Total Quality Management</li>
</ul>

<p>
  <em>WIP</em> (Work in process) is the silent killer. One of the most critical mechanisms in the management of any plant is job and materials release.
</p>

<h3>The Three Ways</h3>

<ol>
  <li>understand how to create fast flow of work as it moves from Development into IT Operations</li>
  <li>how to shorten and amplify feedback loops to fix quality at the source and avoid rework</li>
  <li>how to create a culture that simultaneously fosters experimentation, learning from failure, and understanding that repetition and practice are prerequisites to mastery</li>
</ol>

<h3>The four types of work (as stated by Erik, end of Ch. 7)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Business project work (Ch. 7)</li>
  <li>Internal IT projects (Ch. 9)</li>
  <li>Changes (Ch. 9)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ch. 9 Tue, Sep 9</h3>

<p>
  The most ruthless budget meeting Bill's ever attended.
</p>

<h3>Ch. 10 Thu, Sep 11</h3>

<h2 id="ch1">The Python Data Model</h2>

<p>
  The <em>Python Data Model</em> can be thought of as a framework that formalizes the interfaces of the building blocks of the language. For example, sequences, functions, iterators, coroutines, classes, and context managers.
</p>

<p>
  Special method names are always written with leading and trailing double underscores <code>__</code>. They are also called <em>magic methods</em> and <em>dunder methods</em> (for example, <em>dunder getitem</em>). Some possible constructs are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Collections</li>
  <li>Attribute access</li>
  <li>Iteration and asynchronous iteration</li>
  <li>Operator overloading</li>
  <li>Function and method invocation</li>
  <li>String representation and formatting</li>
  <li>Object creation and destruction</li>
  <li>Managed contexts (<code>with</code> and <code>async</code>)</li>
</ul>

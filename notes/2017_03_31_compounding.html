        <h1>Compounding Interest</h1>
        <h3>31st March, 2017</h3>

        <div>
            We will begin with the basic equations of going forward in time (using percentage units):
            <pre>
# compounding.py

from math import exp, log

# FUNCTIONS SHOULD RETURN NUMBERS, FORMAT SEPARATELY

def simple_compounding(rate, times, pv=100):
    return "{:.4f}".format(pv * (1 + (rate/100)) ** times)

def continuous_compounding(rate, times, pv=100):
    return "{:.4f}".format(pv * exp((rate/100) * times))
            </pre>
        </div>

        <div>
            A useful conversion is taking a long period, such as a year, and finding the equivalent monthly rate that when compounded simply, will result in the original rate.
            <pre>
def divide_rate(rate, times):
    fv = 1 + (rate/100)
    r = log(fv) / times
    return "{:.6f}%".format((exp(r) - 1) * 100)
            </pre>
        </div>

        <div>
            Suppose I have an investment yielding 10% in a year. What would be the equivalent monthly rate if the investment were to be compounded monthly?
            <pre>
>>> divide_rate(10, 12)
'0.797414%'
>>> simple_compounding(0.797414, 12)
'110.0000'
>>> (1+0.00797414) ** 12
1.0999999943832588
            </pre>
        </div>

        <div>
            If an investment compounds yearly at 10%, what is the equivalent continuously compounding rate?
            <pre>

            </pre>
        </div>
        
        <div>
            Suppose I will need $100,000 in five years, and I have $50,000 to invest. What rate of return do I need?

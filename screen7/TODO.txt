SCREEN 7

NOTE: should not host in heitorchang.github.io because MathJax is over 20 MB
NOTE 2: <pre class="skip"> uses a dummy CSS class to skip automatic execution

TODO
----
[  ] Arithmetic section (arithmetic.html) "write your own function" in this section
[  ] See notes [1] below for the difference between (list) and (quote)
[  ] function (limits) that (print)s graphics boundaries


DONE
----
[OK] Build system like py-book/book-template/build.py


MAYBE
-----
[OK] Add text to canvas
[NO] Check if custom fonts can be used


LATER
-----
[  ] Rename SCREEN 7 to something more apropos to content
[  ] Custom fonts in graphics box

One subtlety about quote is that a quote expression doesn't create a data structure every time it's called--evaluating the same expression many times may return many pointers to the same structure.

Consider the procedure definition

(define (foo)
  '(1 2 3))

The list (1 2 3) may be created when we define the procedure foo, and each time we call it, it may return a pointer to that same list. (Exactly what happens depends on the particular implementation of Scheme, but most work this way, for efficiency reasons. Evaluating the quote expression just fetches a pointer to a data structure that was created beforehand.)

For this reason, it's an error to modify a data structure returned from a quote form. Unfortunately, many Scheme systems don't detect this error, and will let you do it.

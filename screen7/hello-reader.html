<h1>1. Hello, Reader!</h1>

<p>Welcome and thank you for joining me in this programming journey! I will cover the basics of computer science and geometry with traditional text-based output and two-dimensional graphics.</p>

<p>The programming language you will be working with is called <em>Scheme</em>. It is a minimalistic language and fundamental computer science concepts can be expressed without complicated syntax.</p>

<p>In this book, there will not be any convoluted code. The code editor is fairly limited, and chapter examples will be written as stand-alone entities that won't require loading code from previous chapters.</p>

<p>After finishing this book you will be able to apply what you have learned to a full-fledged language (or languages) of your choice. Just like spoken languages share elements of grammar, programming languages have many concepts in common with each other.</p>

<h3>Hello, World!</h3>

<p>The typical first program in introductory books displays the words <code>Hello, World!</code> on the screen.</p>

<p>Scheme allows you to type code and immediately run it, as opposed to <em>compiled</em> languages, where an intermediate step of translating human-readable code to machine language code needs to happen.</p>

<p>This book includes a Scheme <em>interpreter</em>, which is a piece of software that reads Scheme code and runs it.</p>

<p>There are several <em>code boxes</em> in lighter yellow in this book. Clicking inside any one of them will copy its contents to the code editor on the top-left corner and run it right away. It saves you from having to type them.</p>

<p>Click on the box below to run the <code>Hello, World!</code> program:</p>

<pre class="codeBlock">(print "Hello, World!")</pre>

<p>You should see the Scheme code and below it, the text <code>Hello, World!</code> inside the dark blue box under the editor. This box is called the <em>console</em>, and it displays the results of your code and values passed to the <code>print</code> function.</p>

<p>A <em>function</em> is a collection of code that performs an action. In <code>print</code>'s case, the action is to output a value to the console. For now, it's enough to know that a function is <em>called</em>, or run, by writing its name and the values it should process inside parentheses <code>(...)</code></p>

<p>Details about functions and how write your own will be explained later.</p>

<h3>The graphics box</h3>

<p>Drawing shapes and plotting data plays a big role in this book. Below is a bit of code that draws a bullseye pattern of circles. Click anywhere inside the code box to run it:</p>

<pre class="codeBlock">(define (centered-circle radius)
  (circle 0 0 radius))

(clear)
(set-stroke! "skyblue")
(for-each centered-circle (iota 4 10 50))</pre>
<p>Each portion of the code block above will be explained in the following chapters. This block of code shows what simple Scheme code looks like.</p>

<p>Can you guess how the code is related to the drawing? <code>centered-circle</code> draws a circle centered at <code>(0, 0)</code> with the given <code>radius</code>, and the <code>iota</code> function creates <code>4</code> values, starting at <code>10</code>, with an increment of <code>50</code> at each step.</p>

<p>The <em>radius</em> of a circle is the distance from the center to the edge.</p>

<p><code>set-stroke!</code> is a function that sets the color of shape outlines. We are setting it to <code>"skyblue"</code>.</p>

<p>Using <code>for-each</code> to call the <code>centered-circle</code> function makes Scheme draw four circles with radii of <code>10</code>, <code>60</code>, <code>110</code>, and <code>160</code> pixels. A pixel is a small graphical unit, used to place points and shapes in the two-dimensional space.</p>

<p>The default dimensions of the graphics box is <em>360 pixels by 360 pixels</em>, with limits of <code>-180 <= x &lt; 180</code> and <code>-180 <= y &lt; 180</code>. Later, we will see how to change these limits.</p>

<p><code>(clear)</code> is added so that the graphics box is cleared before drawing the picture.</p>

<p>Try writing your own values of <code>iota</code>. Remember, the first number is how many circles to draw, the second number is the initial radius, and the last number is how far apart the remaining circles should be.</p>

<p>Try, for example, <code>(iota 3 100 20)</code> and press <code>Ctrl+Enter</code> to redraw. You should see three circles with a large initial radius, and two slightly larger circles.</p>

<p>If you prefer, you may press <code>Alt</code> instead of <code>Ctrl</code> in all of these keyboard shortcuts.</p>

<p>If you wish to clear the code editor's contents after running your code, press <code>Shift+Ctrl+Enter</code>.</p>

<p>To restore previous code, press <code>Ctrl+Up</code>. Code that has not run will be lost, so be careful! (In the Chrome browser, <code>Ctrl-Z</code> will undo this action).</p>

<p><code>Ctrl+Down</code> will scroll forwards in the code history.</p>

<p>Finally, to clear the contents of the code editor, press <code>Esc</code>. The cleared code may be recovered with <code>Ctrl+Up</code>.</p>

<p>Here's a summary of the code editor's keyboard shortcuts (<code>Ctrl</code> and <code>Alt</code> are interchangeable).</p>
